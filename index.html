					CMSC 12<br>
					It was the first course that I took in college and introduced me to a<br>

				<td>
					Favorite GE:

				<td>
					SAS 1<br>
					I think SAS 1 is a good course because it talks about knowing oneself<br>
					and the relation of the self to the society and vice versa. <br>

				<td>
					Favorite PL:

				<td>
					Java<br>
					I think Java is powerful but is also a difficult language to master. <br>
					It requires time and effort to fully understand and be efficient in<br>
					this programming language. I had fun exploring it especially GUI.<br>
