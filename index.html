		Name: Lester Jan M. Bautista <br>
		Nickname: Les <br>
		Favorite CMSC Subject: CMSC 12<br>
		It was the first course that I took in college and introduced me to a<br>
		new language Python. I also enjoyed the exercises done in the course.<br>

		Favorite GE: SAS 1<br>
		I think SAS 1 is a good course because it talks about knowing oneself<br>
		and the relation of the self to the society and vice versa. <br>

		Favorite PL: Java<br>
		I think Java is powerful but is also a difficult language to master. <br>
		It requires time and effort to fully understand and be efficient in<br>
		this programming language. I had fun exploring it especially GUI.<br>

		Favorite Food: Nuts <br>
